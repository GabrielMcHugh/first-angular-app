### Fundamentals
- Typescript Interfaces
    - 'Inline annotation'
    - Defines the shape of an object
- 'Cohesion' - coding principle
    - Group related code together with a class
    - field and methods OOP
- Access modifiers
    - In ts you can initalise variable in constructor using them
- Decorators
    - Component and NgModule decorators: how angular transforms classes
    into angular objects
- String Interpolation
    - The two `{}` curly braces baby!
- Directives
    - Used to change DOM elements
    - like attributes in html e.g `*ngFor=""`
- Dependency Injection
- Coupling & Decoupling
    - You **Tightly Couple** a component to a service when you instantiate a new service in a components constructor
    - You should **Decouple** a service from a component by including the service as a parameter in the component constructor

- Dependency Injection
    - The thing that effed me up in that compare the market interview and made me realise I was a scrub that needed to formally study Angular
    - When you register a dependency as a provider in a module, Angular will create a single instance of that class for the entire module. So if there are 100 components in a class, Angular will create a singular service object shared among all those classes This **design pattern** is called a **Singleton**
    - When you add a service in a component constructor, you are making it a dependancy of that class
    - When Angular creates a component
        1. First it will instantiate the dependancies of that class. Then... ->
        2. It will inject those dependencies into the constructor of that class
    This is what we call **DEPENDENCY INJECTION**

- @Injectable
    - Decorator which tells Angular that a class is includes dependencies in its constructor
    - Isn't needed to be declared in the Component class because it is already included internally
### Displaying Data and Handling Events
- Property Binding and Attribute Binding
    - one way
    - Dom is a tree of objects vs HTML is a markup language representing the DOM in text
    - 1 to 1 mapping of html and DOM properties
    - Property binding targets the DOM
    - to target html we use `[attr.colspan]` colspan being an example
- Class Binding
    - Can bind conditional classes by specifying `[class.btn]="{{ condition }}` (btn being an example class)
- Style Binding
    - Similar to class binding
    - Applies inline styles based on condition e.g. `[style.backgroundColor]="isActive ? 'blue' : 'white'"`
- Event Binding
    - $event
    - Event Bubbling. Event will apply for all surrounding parent elements in html
- Event filtering
    - Can do `keyup.enter` which says that the key must be 'enter' for the event instead of putting an if condition in the function call
- Template Variables
- Two-Way Binding
- Pipes
    - Format data with pipes (current, number, uppercase etc.)
    - Can make custom pipes
    - Common Module
### Building Re-usable components
- Component API's
    - Inputs and Outputs
    - `@Input()` and `@Output` properties = the API
    - **Aliasing** Can supply an alias to the Input so you don't have to change it every time ***keep the contract stable***
- Passing Event Data
    - Output is an event emitter
    - Can emit an object with custom data instead of a DOM event object
- Templates and styles can be in the component or their own file
- **View Encapsulation**
    - How styling is scoped to just the component
    - Can either emulate the Shadow dom by adding unique attributes to the component html
    - You can also specify native which uses the shadow dom
    - or you can have your styling not be specific and instead apply globally
- ngContent & ngContainer
    - Insert html from parent component by using ngContent in the child and ngContainer in the parent
